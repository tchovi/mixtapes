# mixtapes
Python script that allows users to upload Mixtapes in 320 kps mp3 format
I have a nostalgia for the old website datpiff and I decided to attempt to create a script that can potentially replace it. Here are all that you will require for this build in a step-by-step fashion. Enjoy:

  Install Python: Python download https://www.python.org/downloads/
  Install MariaDB: Follow the installation guide from https://www.mariadbtutorial.com/getting-started/install-mariadb/
  pip install Flask Flask-MySQLdb
  You'll use vanilla JavaScript for frontend interactivity.

Create a virtual environment:
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # Activate it

Create the File Structure
  scss ()

Backend (Flask) – app.py

Database (MariaDB) – models.py

Frontend (HTML & CSS)
Home Page – home.html
Featured Page – featured.html
Contact Page – contact.html
Dependencies – requirements.txt
